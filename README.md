# DSA_Assignment_Sarthak
This repository includes two C++ programs for a DSA assignment: one finds the first and last position of a target in a sorted array using binary search, and the other implements a stack using an array with push, pop, top, and empty operations, following the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle.
